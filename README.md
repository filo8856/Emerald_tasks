# AI-Powered Personal Planning & Scheduling Agent

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Personal Planning & Scheduling Agent** is an intelligent assistant that helps users plan their day or week efficiently. Users can provide tasks in natural language, and the system will reason about priorities, effort, deadlines, and personal constraints, automatically scheduling tasks in the user’s Google Calendar.

The system architecture combines:

* **Flutter frontend** – for task input and user interaction.
* **Firebase Authentication** – to securely sign in users via Google accounts.
* **Google Calendar API** – to read and write calendar events using OAuth tokens.
* **AI module (Python + Gemini)** – to prioritize tasks based on natural language input and return an optimal task execution order.

---

## Features

* **Natural Language Task Input**
  Users can describe tasks in plain English, including optional details like deadlines, estimated effort, or priority.

* **Clarification & Context Gathering**
  The AI module can ask follow-up questions to fill in missing details such as task duration, urgency, flexibility, or dependencies.

* **AI-Powered Prioritization**
  Gemini-based reasoning generates a task priority order that balances deadlines, effort, and importance.

* **Google Calendar Integration**
  Reads existing events and schedules tasks in available time slots without conflicts.

* **Automatic Scheduling**
  Creates events in Google Calendar while respecting working hours, breaks, and required intervals between tasks.

* **Dynamic Rescheduling**
  Updates schedules in real-time when tasks change or new tasks are added, providing explanations for any adjustments.

## Requirements

* Flutter 3.x+
* Dart 3.x+
* Firebase project for authentication
* Google Cloud project with Calendar API enabled
* Python 3.9+ (for Gemini AI module)
* Internet connection

---

## Usage

### 1. Set Up Firebase Authentication

1. Create a Firebase project.
2. Enable **Google Sign-In** in Firebase Authentication.
3. Add your Flutter app to Firebase and download `google-services.json` (Android) or `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS).
4. Configure FlutterFire in your project.

### 2. Run the Flutter App

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The app provides a user interface to:

* Sign in with Google.
* Add tasks in natural language.
* Review clarifications from the AI module.
* View the scheduled tasks in Google Calendar.

### 3. AI Module (Python + Gemini)

1. Set up your Python environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the AI module server or API endpoint.

   * The module receives task data from the Flutter app.
   * Gemini processes the tasks, assigns priority, and returns the execution order.

### 4. Google Calendar Integration

* The Flutter app sends the OAuth token to the AI module.
* The AI module uses the token with the Google Calendar API to schedule tasks based on Gemini’s priorities.
* All tasks are created as events in the user’s Google Calendar with no overlaps.

### 5. Updating Tasks

* Add, edit, or remove tasks anytime via the Flutter app.
* The AI module will recompute priorities and update Google Calendar events dynamically.

## Example Task Input

```text
- Finish project report, due Friday, estimated 3 hours
- Prepare presentation slides, medium priority
- Team meeting tomorrow at 2 PM
- Lunch break from 12 PM to 1 PM
```

---

## Future Enhancements

* Personalized learning to adapt task priorities based on user behavior.
* Integration with other task management apps like Todoist or Asana.
* Multi-user scheduling and collaboration.
* Support for recurring tasks and habits.

## How the App Works (User Flow)


### 1. Login Screen

When the user opens the app, they are greeted with a **Welcome screen** displaying:

* A welcome message
* A subtitle: **“Sign in to continue”**
* A **“Sign in with Google”** button at the bottom

This button performs **Firebase Google Authentication**.

During sign-in:

* The user selects the Google account that is linked to their **Google Calendar**
* The app requests permission to **access and manage the user’s Google Calendar**
* Once the user approves, they are logged into the app

---

### 2. “My Tasks” Screen

After login, the user lands on the **My Tasks screen**, which is the main workspace of the app.

**AppBar:**

* **Left:** Sign-out button
* **Right:** “Proceed” button (takes user to the next step)

**Main Body:**

* Initially empty
* Filled with tasks generated by **Gemini AI** from the user’s natural language prompt

**Bottom Section:**

* A text field where the user can type a prompt like:
  *“Prepare slides for client meeting by tomorrow, study for exam this weekend”*
* A **“Generate Tasks”** button

On clicking **Generate Tasks**:

* The prompt is sent to the **Gemini AI module**
* Gemini converts the prompt into structured tasks
* These tasks appear in the main body with:

  * **Task Name**
  * **Difficulty Rating:** Easy / Medium / Hard
  * **Deadline:** Date + Time

---

### 3. Null Check & Clarification Screen

When the user clicks the **top-right Proceed button**, the app moves to a **validation screen**.

This screen ensures that all tasks have enough information to be scheduled.

If any task is incomplete or missing details, the app shows:

* Which fields are missing
  *(for example: missing deadline, duration, or difficulty)*

At the bottom of this screen, the user can:

* Enter additional information in natural language
  *(e.g., “The report needs 2 hours and should be done before Friday”)*
* Click **“Add Tasks”**

This updates the existing tasks with the missing details.

---

### 4. Scheduling Tasks into Google Calendar

Once all tasks are complete, clicking **“Add Tasks”** now will:

1. Send the finalized tasks to the **Gemini AI module**
2. Gemini assigns priorities and determines optimal scheduling
3. The app uses the **Google Calendar API** with the user’s OAuth token
4. Each task is created as a **calendar event**, respecting:

   * Existing calendar events
   * Working hours
   * Break durations

The user can now open their Google Calendar and see all the scheduled tasks.

---

### Summary

In simple terms:

**Login → Enter Prompt → Generate Tasks → Fill Missing Details → Schedule in Google Calendar**

This creates a smooth, intelligent workflow where the AI agent helps the user plan and schedule their life efficiently.
